# 105torus

{EPITECH} | First year | Math project

Drawing circles, cylinders and cones is a good start for an image synthesis software, but one have to admit
it is not fully satisfying... 
This project is the continuation of the previous one, and should allow you to draw more complex forms, 
such as a torus, which do not emerge from 2nd degree equations, but from superior degree equations (4th degree in the torus case).

The objective of this project is to solve a 4th degree equation. 
A direct resolution method does exist (Ferrari’s method), but does not generalize to higher degrees. Thus, 
we will rather compare 3 iterative algorithms:

  - The bisection method
  - Newton’s method
  - The secant method

See the subject for further details !
